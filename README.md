Low-Poly Procedural Terrain Generation

![](screenshot.png)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/)
If you are on macOS and have homebrew installed you should be able to do this with:
```shell
brew install glfw
brew install glm
```

### 2. Build the Project
Again, if you are on macOS the following should work as is:
```shell
make
./build/Artemis
```
Otherwise you have to change the `Makefile` accordingly.
